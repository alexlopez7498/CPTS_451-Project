# Sprint 1 Report 
Video Link: video(https://youtu.be/VoTp32yBlgU)
## What's New (User Facing)
 * ER Diagram
 * User Stories
 * PostgreSQL Database has been set up

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint was more focused on the documentation and planning of our project. To start, we had to decide what type of project and what data we had to deal with, eventually deciding to create a full-stack application for Olympic athlete data over the years. After this, we had to create user stories, an ER diagram to plan how our tables in the database would be created, and write a project report documenting our ideas and plans for this project. We also built a Kanban board for our team to understand and be able to monitor the contributions of each team member, and as of now, we have a fully set-up board with issues assigned to individual members. We are fully prepared to create and integrate a frontend with UI that is user-friendly with the database we have created for this project.

## Unfinished Work
We need to mainly focus on the frontend development for this project as this is what we need to further implement features. Other than that, we have made great progress on our queries and creating our tables for the data.
